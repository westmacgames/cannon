# Cannon
Prototype game where you use a cannon to shoot plates.

What you do with this project doesn't concern me, it isn't a "full game", just something I did to pass the time. If you want to use the scripts, systems or anything in here, feel free to do so.

# Features
1. Plate destruction
2. Sound Effects
3. Controller Support with an implementation of Unity's new input system.
4. Blender Files
### Have Fun!
