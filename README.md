# Cannon
Prototype game where you use a cannon to shoot plates!

What you do with this project doesn't concern me, it isn't a "full game", just something I had some time to do. If you want to implement the scripts, systems or anything in here, feel free to use it.

# Features
1. Plate destruction
2. Sound Effects
3. Controller Support with an implementation of Unity's new input system.

### Have Fun!
